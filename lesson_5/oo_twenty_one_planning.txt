Descripton:
Twenty-One is a game with a player and dealer, with the object being to get your
card values as close to 21 as possible. If a player goes over 21, they 'bust'
and lose the game.
  - Each game starts with the player and dealer being dealt two cards, with both
  player cards being visible but only one of the dealer cards being so
  - The dealer will deal cards until they have a minimum of 17
points or bust. All new dealer cards are visible.
  - Each turn, the player has the option to 'hit' or 'stay', with hit getting a
  new card and stay ending their turns for the game
  - Cards 2-10 have face value, Queen, Jack, and King have the value of 10, and
  ace has a value of 11 if the total would be at/less than 21 or 1 the value
  would otherwise be over 21.
  - The game ends when both the player and dealer stays or when one busts
