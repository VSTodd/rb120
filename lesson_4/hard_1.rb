# Building on the prior vehicles question, we now must also track a basic
# motorboat. A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves
# similar to a catamaran. Therefore, creators of Motorboat instances don't need
# to specify number of hulls or propellers. How would you modify the vehicles
# code to incorporate a new Motorboat class?

# Question 3
# The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment
# for how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne vehicles, due to
# prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even
# if the vehicle is out of fuel.

# Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles
# is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range
# method will return an additional 10km.
